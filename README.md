# Emotion Journal: A Literary Approach to Understanding Feelings

> *"I live in two worlds, one is a world of books."* - Rory Gilmore

## üìñ Project Overview

Emotion Journal is a web-based application that analyzes your written thoughts and feelings to detect underlying emotions. Inspired by Rory Gilmore's love for journaling and literature, this project combines technology with the timeless practice of self-reflection through writing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes text input to identify 15 different emotional states
- **Visual Representation**: Displays a representative image for each detected emotion
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows how confident the system is about its analysis
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Identifies and displays the specific words that triggered each emotion
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices, just like a well-loved book

## üß† How It Works

The application uses a comprehensive keyword-based analysis system to detect emotions. Here's the literary breakdown:

1. **Text Input**: Users write about their feelings in a textarea (like a digital journal entry)
2. **Keyword Analysis**: The system scans the text for emotional keywords across 15 emotion categories
3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Each emotion category receives a score based on keyword frequency
4. **Emotion Detection**: The emotion with the highest score is selected as the primary emotion
5. **Visual Feedback**: A representative image is displayed along with the detected emotion and confidence level

The current emotion categories include:
- Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful, Disgusted, Neutral
- Love, Confused, Tired, Bored, Grateful, Optimistic, Pessimistic, Excited, Lonely
